# SPCM Laboratory Notebook

Klementine Burrell-Sander is a PhD student at the University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia. She is in the [SCOPE](https://github.com/alintheopen/SCOPE) research group led by [Associate Professor Alice Motion](http://alicemotion.com/) and the [Rutledge](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/chemistry/~rutledge/home.htm) group led by [Professor Peter Rutledge](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/peter-rutledge.html), and is currently working on the [Open Source TB](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/) project as well as the [Breaking Good](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject) project. This ELN was started in March 2022. 

To navigate this ELN, please start at the Wiki page. This contains a brief summary of the various lines of work being pursued and links to specific reactions.

The best way to find a relevant ELN entry is to start in the Wiki where you can identify the compound/s and which project it belongs to. Opening the project it belongs to in the Projects tab then gives you a list of all the issues that are relevant to that project. Here you can look for those with the identifier for the molecule of interest. Clicking on a given title will take you to the issue for the ELN entry. Each title is categories based on its status - to-do, in progress, complete.

## Experiment Identifiers

Experiments conducted for **Open Source Tuberculosis** are identified as follows:

_KBSX-Y_

where
- KBS is the initials of the experimentalist (Klementine Burrell-Sander)
- X is a number used to identify the molecule
- Y is a number that indicates how many times the reaction has been repeated

For example, **KBS19-3** indicates the **third** attempt at synthesising molecule **KBS19**


Experiments conducted for The Breaking Good Project are identified as follows:

Year of program
Underscore
Program the molecule is contributing to e.g. SSP (The University of Sydney's Special Studies program), BG (breaking good core program)
Underscore
One number followed by a letter - the main identifier of the molecule that is being synthesised
Underscore
A number which indicates the batch number/number of attempts

For example, **2022_BG_1J_002** describes the **second** attempt at the synthesis of molecule **1J** for the core Breaking Good program ran in **2022**.
