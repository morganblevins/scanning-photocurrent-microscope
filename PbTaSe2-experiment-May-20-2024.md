Starting with the "orange" flake on the PbTaSe2 chip 4. First I do a quick reflection map of a flake that is not part of the circuit to confirm the system is working.

Next I perform a reflection map of the entire flake now that I see the setup is working. 


## Experiment Identifiers

Experiments conducted for the **Scanning Photocurrent Microscope** (SPCM) are identified as follows:

_KBSX-Y_

where
- KBS is the initials of the experimentalist (Klementine Burrell-Sander)
- X is a number used to identify the molecule
- Y is a number that indicates how many times the reaction has been repeated

For example, **KBS19-3** indicates the **third** attempt at synthesising molecule **KBS19**


Experiments conducted for The Breaking Good Project are identified as follows:

Year of program
Underscore
Program the molecule is contributing to e.g. SSP (The University of Sydney's Special Studies program), BG (breaking good core program)
Underscore
One number followed by a letter - the main identifier of the molecule that is being synthesised
Underscore
A number which indicates the batch number/number of attempts

For example, **2022_BG_1J_002** describes the **second** attempt at the synthesis of molecule **1J** for the core Breaking Good program ran in **2022**.
