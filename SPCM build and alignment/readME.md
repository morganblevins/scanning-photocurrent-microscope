Information on the status of scanning photocurrent microscope (SPCM) system in the Boriskina lab and its alignment procedure

To start, here is an [overview of the entire SPCM system](Total%20SPCM%20system%20overview.md).

[Here](PCBs%20and%20samples.md) is what the samples for the SPCM look like and how they attach to PCBs and the electronics of the system.

And, getting more into the weeds, here is [how to optically align the system](Alignment%20procedure%20for%20SPCM.md), how to integrate the [quantum cascade laser](QCL%20integration.md) and how to add in an [optical chopper system ](Optical%20chopper%20for%20633nm%20diode.md)

And here is a reminder of the goal of a SPCM:

The Scanning Photocurrent Microscope (SPCM) setup measures simultaneous maps of the photocurrent and reflection of a target material. These maps reveal the underlying physics of photocurrents in materials by revealing the spatial location of currents and their direction. 
SPCM studies are key to understanding the origins of the photogalvanic effect (PGE), an effect which enables spontaneous, p-n junction-less photocurrents in inversion symmetry-breaking materials. The linear PGE (LPGE), also called shift current, is manifested as the shift in space of a charge carrier during the inter-band photoexcitation process under illumination by linearly polarized light, stemming from the I-symmetry breaking of the material (Dai 2023).  Berry flux fields contribute to shift current, making WSMs attractive material candidates for observing this effect (Liu 2020, Weng 2019, Osterhoudt). In the circular PGE (CPGE), illumination from circularly polarized light selectively excites charge carriers with preferred linear momenta supporting a net photocurrent in certain symmetry groups of I-symmetry-breaking WSM or strained DSM materials.
Additionally, the PGE can be unlocked in centrosymmetric materials by engineering strain gradients into the materials, a technique called “flexoelectricity”. SPCM measurements of photocurrents in these samples are especially important for understanding this effect and identifying flexoelectric coefficient in candidate materials.
