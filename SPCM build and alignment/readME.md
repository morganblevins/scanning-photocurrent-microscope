Information on the status of scanning photocurrent microscope system in the Boriskina lab and its alignment procedure

To start, here is an [overview of the entire SPCM system](Total%20SPCM%20system%20overview.md).

[Here](PCBs%20and%20samples.md) is what the samples for the SPCM look like and how they attach to PCBs and the electronics of the system.

[How to optically align the system
](Alignment%20procedure%20for%20SPCM.md)

And, getting more into the weeds, here is how to integrate the [QCL](QCL%20integration.md) and how to add in an [optical chopper system ](Optical%20chopper%20for%20633nm%20diode.md)
